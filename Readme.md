# Dockerized Service-Kommune Builder

All files necessary to create the Service-Kommune Builder, a Docker container with all required dependencies to build, test and deploy SK projects.

This repo is hosted in SEITENBAU's Service-Kommune Bitbucket project, as well as on [GitHub](https://github.com/Nijin22/service-kommune-builder) (so we can use Docker Hub to build the images)
